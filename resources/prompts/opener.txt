Help a guy write the first message to a girl.
It should be not too long, engaging, interesting, and intriguing. Add emojis.
Write a ready-to-send message, without templates or signatures.
The next message will contain some information about the girl (you donâ€™t need to refer to it directly, just use it to make the message better).
